Welcome to ZendTo (C) Julian Field 2011 Jules@Zend.To

Please start at the web site http://zend.to/ as it contains all the
documentation you need to get started. However, other documentation is
included in the package you downloaded.

If you are using one of the VMware Virtual Machine distributions of
ZendTo then read the entire ReadMe text file that was part of the zip
you downloaded. Then dig into /opt/zendto/config/preferences.php for the
application settings, and /opt/zendto/config/zendto.conf for the user
interface settings.

If you need to use MySQL instead of SQLite, then you will need to setup
the database first, so look in the /opt/zendto/sql/ directory for help.

*** NOTE ***
The "cache" and "templates_c" must be writeable by the user and group
that your web server is running as!
As must the directory containing the log and the SQLite database file.
*** NOTE ***

Please see http://zend.to for all the other documentation, as well as
all the documentation you will find in this package.
