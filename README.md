# ZendTo
Fork of zend.to file sharing. The goal is to provide php7 support and other enhancements.

Short roadmap:

1. Get progress bar working with php7
2. Allow entering an email address in the send text box. Currently, the process is to hit the plus button, and fill out the dialog. This is not an optimal flow.
3. Create a set of installation / configuration scripts. Currently, two files are hand-edited to set up Zend.to.
4. Create option to use HTML formatted emails. There is a discussion on the zend.to mailing list that details what needs changed behind the scenes, but there needs to be an interface to select the mail format.

The original zend.to project is hosted at http://zend.to
