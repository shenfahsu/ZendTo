This describes how to setup MySQL for use with ZendTo.

Setting up the MySQL database can be done by creating an empty database,
importing the table layout and granting the proper permissions to the
zendto user. Here is an example of that procedure:

# mysql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE zendto;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON zendto.* TO zendto@localhost
    IDENTIFIED by 'password';
mysql> quit

# mysql --force --user=zendto --password='password' zendto < zendto.MySQL

Note: 'password' is the master password for the zendto user.
      I strongly recommend that you replace this with a more secure
      password. Please remember that you will need to specify all
      the database connection details in 'config/preferences.php'.

Note: The '--force' option is needed to correct an earlier schema error
      in the 'addressbook' table. It won't wipe your tables!

Note: If you are upgrading from a previous version of ZendTo and the
      database has changed, just do the last "mysql" command given
      above. It will not delete anything, don't worry, it will just
      add any new tables necessary.

** IMPORTANT FOR MyZendTo USERS **
Note: If you are using MyZendTo and are upgrading from 4.02 or earlier,
      you don't have quotas in your usertable. To add these, do this:
      # mysql --user=zendto --password='password' zendto
      alter table usertable add column quota real after organization;
      quit
      You must then run /opt/zendto/bin/setquota.php for *every* user
      to set their quota, or things will go horribly wrong. :)
