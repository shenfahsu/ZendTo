If you want to use SQLite with ZendTo, just ensure you have PHP's
SQLite support installed, and then set the relevant settings in
www/preferences.php to tell it to use SQLite and the path to the
zendto.sqlite database file.

If the database file doesn't already exist, it will create it for you
automatically.

If you are upgrading from Dropbox, then see the sbin/UPGRADE
directory, there is a README in there that will tell you what to do.
