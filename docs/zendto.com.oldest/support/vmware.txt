This is how to setup the VMware image, once you have converted the OVA
file into a virtual machine.

In the second section, I will explain how to build a VM from the OVA
file if you cannot import the OVA file successfully.

Setting up the Ubuntu Dropoff Server

Being a Ubuntu system, direct access to the root account is blocked.
You can login with
  Username = zendto
  Password = zendto
Please change this password immediately!
There is a huge amount of documentation about Ubuntu on the web, so this
should be your first place to look for information not provided here or
on the Dropoff website or sites linked from there.

The VM builds will get their network settings from DHCP.
If you need to use static addressing, edit /etc/network/interfaces (on
Ubuntu / Debian systems), or /etc/sysconfig/network and
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth* (on RedHat / CentOS systems)

On an Ubuntu or Debian system, get root by using this command:
  sudo su -

Then edit
  /opt/zendto/config/preferences.php
and
  /opt/zendto/config/zendto.conf
to setup the ZendTo package for your site. Refer to
  http://www.zendto.com/support
for more information about setting up the user authentication in
particular. Most of the rest of preferences.php should be left alone
once you have got the authentication working, then only change it a
little at a time until it displays and works how you want it to.

The supplied preferences.php works by using IMAP authentication.
It treats ZendTo recipients as local if their email address matches
*@soton.ac.uk or *@*.soton.ac.uk. I have personally only ever used the
Active Directory authentication module, so please don't ask me much
about the other authentication systems it supports!

To update your Ubuntu system to the latest versions and apply all patches,
run these commands:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
You may need to reboot after applying these patches.

**************************************
*** IMPORTING THE OVA FILE BY HAND ***
**************************************

Many systems will apparently not import the OVA file successfully.
However, you can still easily convert it into a Virtual Machine.
The OVA file is actually just a tar archive, so rename it to end in
".tar" instead of ".ova". Then extract all the files from that tar
archive. You will get 3 files:
1. .mf - This is checksums of the other files in the archive.
2. .ovf - This describes the virtual hardware in a readable XML format.
3. .vmdk - This is the virtual hard disk image.

So create a new VM, with these settings:
* Operating System is Linux, Ubuntu 10 64-bit
* 1 processor
* 1 SCSI controller, an "LSI Logic Parallel"
* 1 network adapter, preferably a pcnet32 or else e1000
* 800MB RAM is plenty
* Create the hard disk using an existing virtual hard disk,
  and set it to the .vmdk file you just created from the archive.

That's about all you should need.
With any luck it will boot when you power it on!

Now go and read the first half of this document again, as that will
tell you what to do next.
