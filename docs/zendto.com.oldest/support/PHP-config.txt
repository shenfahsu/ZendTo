There are a few php.ini settings which you need to change, as well as
the >2Gb uploads patch mentioned elsewhere on this site.

The following settings allow the script to upload for 2 hours,
with a max upload size of roughly 50Gbytes.

; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_execution_time = 7200
; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
max_input_time = 7200
; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (16MB)
memory_limit = 300M

post_max_size = 50000000000

; Whether to allow HTTP file uploads.
file_uploads = On

; Temporary directory for HTTP uploaded files (will use system default if not
; specified).
; Set this to the absolute path of your zendto/incoming directory.
; Otherwise it will probably use /tmp which is not what you want!
upload_tmp_dir = /var/zendto/incoming

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 50000000000
