On Ubuntu, where I wrote all of this, SELinux is known as "AppArmor".
But the principal is the same.

If you find that the virus-scanning is always failing with permissions errors,
you need to add this to the usr.sbin.clamd file in your /etc/apparmor.d
directory, or equivalent.

  # JKF Allow dropoffs to be scanned
  /var/zendto/** r,

where /var/zendto is the *absolute* location of all your ZendTo-related
uploads.

Don't forget to restart apparmor or SELinux after changing this file!
