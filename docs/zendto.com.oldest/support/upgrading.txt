In addition to getting all the preferences right in www/preferences.php,
you need to extend the database schema to add a new table and a new column
to an exisitng table.

1. Stop Apache
==============
Do this by whatever method is right for your system.
You don't want your users messing with the database file while you are
upgrading it.

2. Backup Your dropbox.sqlite File
==================================
In the www directory of your Dropbox/Dropoff installation, the
preferences.php file will tell you where your dropbox.sqlite file is
stored. Take a very safe copy of the dropbox.sqlite file, so you can
start again if anything goes wrong.

3. Add the "AuthTable" Table to the Database
============================================
Do this by running
  cd /opt/zendto/sbin
  php addAuthTable.php /opt/zendto/config/preferences.php
where you should replace the last command-line argument with the full
absolute path to your ZendTo preferences.php file.

4. Add the "note" Column to the "dropoff" Table in the Database
===============================================================
Do this by running
  cd /opt/zendto/sbin
  sh addNotesColumn.sh /var/zendto/zendto.sqlite /opt/zendto/config/preferences.php
where you should replace the first argument with the full path of your
zendto.sqlite file (you found this in step 2, above). You should replace
the second argument with the full path of your ZendTo preferences.php
file (you found this in step 3, above).

5. Done
=======
You have now finished upgrading the Dropbox/Dropoff database to ZendTo.
